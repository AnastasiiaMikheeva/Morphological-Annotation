# Morphological Errors Annotation

## Obtaining the Annotated Data
This is a project for morphological annotation of Learner Corpus of Russian Language. The basis for the project forms the RULEC, which is a large compilation of hand-written and digital data collected from students of Russian as a Foreign Language. The original corpus was created by and belongs to Olesya Kisselev and Anna Alsufieva. The Principal Investigators are Professor Olesya Kisselev, Department of World Languages and Literatures, Portland State University (kisselev@pdx.edu) and Professor Anna Alsufieva, Department of World Languages and Literatures, Portland State University ( alsufiev@pdx.edu ). 

## Corpus description
The materials for RULEC were collected over a period of 4 years from students studying Russian at an American university in a special program that was designed for upper-intermediate and advanced-level Second Language (L2) or Heritage Language (HL) speakers of Russian. The corpus is relatively small: the texts were authored by 36 learners: 17 of the 36 are mainstream American learners who started learning Russian as adults; 19 are heritage speakers of Russian, born in a Russian-speaking country and brought to the US as children or born in the US and raised in a Russian-speaking family. Each author, however, is well-presented in the body of the corpus. RULEC now includes approximately 3,800 written papers ranging from a short paragraph to 8-page research papers (no grammatical or lexical exercises are included in the corpus).

## Corpus Metadata 
The Corpus contains the following metadata: student’s name (pseudonym),
gender, language background and language experience of the student (L2 or HL), student’s linguistic level (established through external tests), time stamp (week and academic year when the paper was written), time limit under which the paper was written (timed or non-timed),
text type (one paragraph or a long research paper), text function (e.g. narration, argumentation), and whether a paper was written individually or in a group.

## Project description for annotation of morphological errors
For the purposes of morphological annotation 66 essays of HL and 70 essays of FL Russian learners on intermediate level were taken. Each of the essays presents a single .txt file. 
The project aims at annotation of morphological errors done by Russian Language learners. 
For annotation the UAM Corpus Tool 3 is used as well as Morphological Analyzer Pymorphy 2 that uses the library which contains classes such as Morphanalyzer and utilizes one of the methods is used for the project .parse.

## Types of Morphological Errors 

1. Derivational morphemes:
a.Derivational suffixex annd prefixes: omission, spelling, insertion, transposition, substitution.
b. Derivational compounding 
2. Inflectional morphemes: 
a. Suffixes: gender, case, plural, infinitive, tense, mood, participle, adverbial_participle, degree.
b. Flections: gender, case, plural, person.

Derivational suffixes in Russian include suffixes that help form words (стол – стол-ик, груз-ить – груз-чик, бел-ый – бел-изн-а).
Derivational prefixes are also very common in the language to build words (пере-делать, с-делать, до-делать, вы-делать). 
One of the most common ways to form a word is compounding where two different roots are added in order to make a single word (пар-о-ход, пут-е-провод). 
Postfixes are suffixes that are attached to a word at the most end after all derivational suffixes (-ся/-сь, -те, -то, -либо, -нибудь).
Inflectional morphemes are divided by suffixes and inflections (or flections). Suffixes refer mainly to the infinitive of a verb (-ти/-тъ); Suffixes attached to a stem of a word in the present or past tense (-л-); Imperative form of a verb (и); Participles (-ущ-, -ющ-, -ащ-, -ящ-, -вш-, -ш-, -им-, -ом-, -ем-, -нн-, -они-, -енн) and adverbial participles (а, -я, -ши, -вши, -учи, -ючи, -ав); comparatives and superlatives by adjectives and adverbs (ее, -ей, -ейш-, -айш-, -ше, -же) ; plurals of nouns (-/-, -ее-, -ен-); null suffixes such as (пёк, вёз). Inflectional morphemes such as flection refer to the categories that change their forms in the process of declension: (мальчик – мальчика, мальчику, мальчиком). Inflected can be nouns and adjectives.
